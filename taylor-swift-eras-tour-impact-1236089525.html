When I reveal myself to be one too — despite being arguably the wrong gender, inarguably old and lacking a telltale “Lover” mascara star over my right eye — his disdain is palpable. Suddenly, I’m getting way more screening questions than anyone not on a watch list should. “What do you like about her?” he sneers, peering up over specs.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This is probably the wrong time for me to point out Swift’s Irish heritage, or to assert that she is this generation’s James Joyce. (The original king of the Easter eggs, right?) I wouldn’t really go that far — I’m only on record as doing my best to certify her as this century’s Beatles. Trying to figure out how to answer him, the past 18 years of extolling Swift in print flash before my eyes. I end up murmuring the bare minimum: “Um, her songwriting.” This seems to disturb him further. He snaps back: “Aren’t they all the same song” — a slight pause, and I know what’s coming next — “about her breakups?” Then, abruptly, he stamps me through, sparing me a detour to Interpol for more grilling.</p><h2 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-padding-t-075 lrv-u-padding-b-050 lrv-a-font-secondary-l u-color-black">Related Stories</h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the cab into town, the driver is blasting a local talk-radio personality sharing his dismay about the fans of an awful superstar taking over his country. The host reads an email sent in from a hater who says, “A year ago, when tickets went on sale, my partner and I made a reservation to take our kids out of the country this Friday morning. … Thank you for creating a safe space with your show.” I start to wonder if Swift might have met her match at the Cliffs of Moher.</p><h3>Popular on Variety</h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">But from my drop-off forward, the next three days are like living in a Swift-topia. The mile and a half to Aviva Stadium each night is like Disneyland when it shuts its doors early for an affinity group. Whether stopping in the pubs or walking through the charming neighborhood of Victorian brick homes adjoining the fancy new stadium, there’s that warm feeling of people who are united by one quality: They are all super in touch with their feelings — or else they wouldn’t be Swift fans. And they all are happy to stop on the street or over pints to talk about poetical expression. (Well, except for the occasional taciturn, invariably straight young male who has signified his supportive-plus-one status by wearing a jersey bearing the name of Swift’s Super Bowl beau, Travis Kelce.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Taylor-Swift-Tour-Variety-Cover-FORWEB.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">So it is that I end up chatting with a middle-aged gay man in a sequin-covered shirt whose female companion whispers to me, while he steps away to trade friendship bracelets with a 10-year-old girl and her mum, that Swift’s music just helped him through a difficult breakup. The girl then runs off to trade her homemade bracelets with a pair of high-helmeted Dublin policemen loaded up to their own elbows with friendship swag — unexpected accessories for long arms of the law.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Unknown-1_c4cfb2.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">All the stories about American Swifties swarming overseas to catch “The Eras Tour” turn out to be true: You couldn’t swing a neon golf club around here without hitting a Yank. Approximately one out of every five fans I approach is visiting from the States — and the jubilation they’re feeling about the night’s impending concert is compounded by the fact that nearly all of them financed a European vacation and a concert ticket for roughly the same amount they would have paid on a secondary ticketing site for a typical four-figure ticket to one of last year’s predatorily repriced U.S. shows.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Remember the venerable stereotype of the Ugly Americans, brusquely trampling over refined Europeans in their travels? Thanks to Taylor Swift, who has a gift for laying out global welcome mats, this is the summer of the Spangly American.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1109619_b360b2.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the stadium on night one, just down the row from me are a group of millennials from New Jersey, several in glam unitards inspired by the “Lover” or “1989” portions of the career-spanning show and looking like they were costumed by Swift’s own designer, with fake jewel-encrusted microphones to match. I ask how many hours went into perfecting these nearly pro-grade outfits.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“About 80 hours for mine,” says Megan McLaughlin. “Hers probably longer,” she adds, nodding toward one of her sisters, Margo Steinberg. “She knows all the glues and the best gems.” Indeed, confirms Steinberg, “I was working on mine since January. And, yes, I did quit my job to finish it!” She adds, when I ask if she cares to share any secrets to a particularly good look, “You have to use the B-7000 glue.” (A third sister,&nbsp;Amelia McLaughlin, admits she resorted to buying her spangly dress off Etsy — “I was doing a PhD, but I had to match these girls’&nbsp;enthusiasm” — while a fourth,&nbsp;Carolyn McLaughlin, skipped the glitter and went for a red dress that matches Swift’s from the “I Bet You Think About Me” video.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Certainly, there is an element of cosplay to many of the fans’ outfits. Some have seen footage of the new segment Swift added to the tour beginning in April 2024 — devoted to her most recent album, the 31-song “Tortured Poets Department” — and have managed to manufacture gowns that look like they’re made of paper and feature lyric excerpts printed on them in script, à la Swift’s custom-made Vivienne Westwood dress. I meet a group of American women who became friends as literature majors in college who have “Tortured Poets”-themed outfits, one duplicating the Westwood dress and the other with handmade printouts of the latest album’s lyrics pinned all over her black dress, as if she were literally pulling pages out of Swift’s playbook.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1109620-rotated.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It’s the devotion to lyrics, even more than glitter, that is most impressive about the bespoke outfits fans have concocted for the occasion. There are scores and scores of Swifties wearing homemade T-shirts — sometimes singular, sometimes matching with a friend, like walking Burma-Shave signs. Some of the messages are obvious, like the dozens of laddies wearing “It’s me, hi, I’m the husband/boyfriend/father, it’s me” shirts. (Bet that seemed really original at one time.) But a lot of them refer to more obscure songs or stanzas, as if every nearby street or stadium loge section is full of human Easter eggs, begging to be unpacked. It’s hard to think of any other superstar in the history of stadium tours who could have inspired as much fan-crafted clothing rooted in the power of words.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Combos of middle-aged mothers and their teen or 20-something daughters abound; some of them have seized on Swift’s mentions of her own mother, Andrea, to come up with their T-shirt ideas. On Lansdowne Road, I talk to a mum whose red-on-black shirt says, “Had to listen to all this drama,” accompanied by a daughter bearing the legend, “And here’s to my mama.” (This is a reference to Swift’s song “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things.”)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1109610.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Later, in a stadium Guinness line, I chat up a pair of thirsty locals, the daughter’s shirt reading “I call my mom, she said …,” with the mom’s shirt completing the thought: “It was for the best.” (Damn it, I had to Google to recall that’s from a “1989” Vault track that came out last year.) I ask the daughter if she had to explain to her mom what she was wearing. “She’s 52,” she replies. “I don’t think she knows.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1109848.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Age is really no guarantor of not getting it — the popular #SwiftieOver50 hashtag on X proves that. Although outnumbered, plenty of older people are unaccompanied by a minor, or by anyone who has been a minor in the past 20 years. I approach a middle-aged couple, Jean Sebastian Conley and Natasha Gagne, again bidden by their matching shirts — “Who’s Taylor Swift?” and “Who’s Travis Kelce?” They turn out to be French Canadians who found their 206-euro SRO tickets to be a steal compared with the extravagant resale prices they briefly considered back home after being shut out of the initial on-sale. I ask what attracted them to Swift since, unlike so many others here, they didn’t grow up with her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I really fell in love with her with the ‘Folklore’ album,” Conley says, referring to her low-key Grammy-winning album recorded during the early months of the pandemic. “I think different audiences and older audiences found her through that and ‘Evermore’ because they were more singer-songwriter, a little bit rougher indie music, and that’s what we like most. So that’s how I got hooked.” For her part, Gagne says, “I like everything she represents. And when she redid all her masters, that’s where I thought she was a lady boss.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1119889.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It’s a reminder that, for however many mini-narratives Swift packs into the three hours and 20 minutes of an “Eras” show, there are really four or five years of backstory that feed into the audience’s shared awareness. When she sings the ominous ballad “My Tears Ricochet,” accompanied by a coven of stone-faced dancers, at least some fans will understand it as a distant reflection of her very public feelings about the men she considers her business bêtes noires, Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta, who bought and sold (respectively) the rights to her first six albums, spawning much vitriol as well as four “Taylor’s Version” rerecorded albums to date.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When the dancers put their grins back on, Swift plays an ebullient excerpt of a very recent “Poets” bonus track, “So High School,” which every person in the crowd will know is inspired by Kelce. There are some breakup songs of recent vintage too — yes, Mr. Customs Man! — like “The Smallest Man in the World,” which may or may not have cost Matty Healy, the 1975 frontman and former Swift paramour, a night of sleep.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The whole tour is themed around not just the newer records but the rerecordings that have made every older album in her catalog feel improbably fresh. It was, quite possibly, the single most baller move in the history of the record industry … and led to the career-retrospective concept for what is already unquestionably the biggest tour in the history of popular music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Taylor-Swift-Fan-Collage.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Any discussion of the charms of fandom isn’t meant to forestall discussion of “The Eras Tour” as big business. The numbers are fuzzy because Swift’s camp does not release grosses from her shows, unlike nearly every other artist at the stadium or arena level. Even when the tour wraps after 20 months on Dec. 8 in Vancouver, it seems likely those numbers will continue to be guarded with a zeal on par with the government of North Korea’s. Many industry experts believe the gross will approach or even surpass $2 billion.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">What is known for certain — even without a confirmation from Swift World — is that she broke the all-time tour-gross figure when she hit the $1 billion mark, whenever exactly that might have been. The two trade publications that specialize in the touring industry have slightly differing estimates: Billboard calculated a cumulative gross of approximately $900 million when she took a break at the end of 2023, figuring that she would crack $1 billion shortly into the tour’s resumption in April, while Pollstar estimated that she had passed $1 billion by the conclusion of last year. Any way you guesstimate it, Swift took less than a year to break the previous record of $939.1 million, which Elton John grossed with his “Farewell Yellow Brick Road” tour across nearly three years of shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Taylor-Swift-Concert-Paris.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">One source close to the production said early in the “Eras Tour” era that her average gross each night is $14 million. Others believe that is a highly conservative estimate, with a possible total that on at least some nights edges closer to $17 million. One remarkable aspect is that this does not include the revenue from any inflated resale tickets — which, as anyone who has tried to get tickets through Vivid Seats or StubHub knows, mostly have gone for several times their face value. It was little publicized, but Swift had “dynamic pricing” turned off for her ticket sales, possibly to avoid the controversies Bruce Springsteen encountered when the face value on some of his tickets leaped to the four-figure range upon their first sale. Swift left money on the table by not participating in the scalping of her own tickets, which had an average price of around $230 and topped out at $499, excepting VIP packages, which zenithed at $899 — all well short of what some other superstars ask nowadays. Of course, neither Argentina nor anyone at Wembley Stadium ahead of Swift’s opening night performance in June will be crying for her when she’s in reach of $2 billion without the resale inflation … not to mention the hundreds of millions of dollars in merch.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">(This is extraordinary also because Swift hasn’t done any press to promote the tour, except for when she was selected as Time Magazine’s Person of the Year in December. But she doesn’t need to — the tour is constantly being celebrated on social media with every outfit change. And it’s also become so huge, it’s featured more A-list sightings than the Oscars, from Julia Roberts to Tom Cruise to Stevie Nicks, who had the surprise song “You’re on Your Own, Kid” dedicated to her in Dublin.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Benson Boone, whose “Beautiful Things” is the most-streamed song of 2024 in the U.S. and the world, says he felt dwarfed when performing as the opening act at one of Swift’s seven shows at London’s Wembley Stadium. He has forever committed to memory the exact attendance figure he was given for the night: “89,497,” he says. “Just her stage alone is bigger than anything I’ve ever seen — 300 feet of it!” he says. “I took in every moment. It was cool for me to experience another artist’s world and learn from it. I want to work that hard and be the captain of my ship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Taylor-Swift-Merchandise.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Although it’s maddening to a media that likes official box office reports and can’t get them, it’s easy to see the wisdom in not flaunting those figures if you’re a superstar artist who counts on being seen as relatable. Swift certainly is proud of breaking records — she posted a tweet when “The Tortured Poets Department” spent its first 12 weeks at No. 1 on the album chart, one of only three albums in history to do so. But she’d rather count fan impressions than dollars. By the same token, she doesn’t publicize or confirm acts of generosity that leak out, like the sizable food-bank donations she makes in every city she tours, or the $100,000 bonuses that the tour’s 50 truck drivers reportedly got for Christmas.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">An addendum to all this is how the “Eras Tour” film — released last fall, less than halfway through the actual tour — grossed just over $180 million domestically and $261 million globally, beating the records set by Justin Bieber’s concert film in the U.S. and Michael Jackson’s globally. Massive big-screen spoilers only heightened, rather than diminished, resale demand for the shows yet to come on the 152-date tour and helped precipitate the movement among Americans to head overseas, to make up for the supply found sorely lacking at home.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“She is the torchbearer for the live industry,” says Andy Gensler, editor of Pollstar. “It’s nothing we’ve ever seen before, and it’ll be a long time before we see it again. Her timing was exquisite: The pandemic created this yearning and hunger for live entertainment like nothing else in our history, so she couldn’t have picked a better time to go out.” Pollstar called last year a “historic golden age” for touring, as the top 100 global tours collectively surpassed $9 billion — up 46% from 2022 — with Swift obviously contributing a significant chunk of that total. (This year, the trade reports that overall tour attendance is down, with flat grosses, representing a slight reckoning for the live industry that, obviously, isn’t impacting “Eras.”)</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“What my partners and I talk a lot about is how it’s one thing to have a big tour in North America. It’s another thing to have an equally big tour wherever you are in the world and to do doubles and triples in these markets,” says Bernie Cahill, an Activist founding partner and manager of acts including the Grateful Dead and the Lumineers. “It’s an anomaly. It’s not normal. And don’t forget, you’re going into what I call asymmetric venues, which are venues that are not really built for music; these are venues that are built for football games or soccer games and can be very challenging to do music. And they get it right every time — Louis Messina [Swift’s tour promoter since her earliest days] and his team are world-class.” But for all that globe-trotting, he notes, “there are some artists that you see do a show and you know they don’t even know what city they’re in. I always feel like Taylor knows exactly where she is. She has a relationship with that city or that market and those fans and she’s connected to them in ways that are very authentic, that you can’t fake.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The one big snafu in the rollout of “The Eras Tour” occurred in November 2022 when the Ticketmaster system melted down after too many North American dates went on sale at once, causing thousands of fans to experience long delays. The on-sale broke the all-time record for tickets sold in a single day at 2 million, but it also nearly broke the world’s largest ticketing platform. Swift herself was Teflon in this situation, as the blame fell on a ticketing system not capable of handling so much of the Swift-loving world at once. And although most of the problems people have with Ticketmaster are different from what fans faced in the “Eras Tour” debacle — mainly, hidden fees and monopolistic practices — it could have big legislative consequences anyway. Dean Budnick, co-author of “Ticket Masters: The Rise of the Concert Industry and How the Public Got Scalped,” believes that the Swift hullabaloo was the main catalyst for Congress enacting reform. “There’s no question that perhaps there’s gonna be some meaningful change in ticketing as a result of what people experienced with that on-sale.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">That sense Cahill spoke about of the singer making it clear to an audience she knows exactly where she’s at is in full force in Dublin. Swift introduces the “Folklore”/”Evermore” segment by suggesting that she had a spiritual locale in mind when she started writing that more intimate material, locked in during the first part of the pandemic. “It keeps me up at night all year long: Which era is the most Irish?” she half-jokes to the crowd. “I’m gonna make a case for it being ‘Folklore’ … This album’s imaginary world had a whole aesthetic — like I lived in this cabin in a really green, nature-y, moss-covered landscape. You see where I’m going?… Another thing that I think makes it more Irish than the other eras is, ‘Folklore’ was all about storytelling. And I know you hear this a lot, but you guys are naturally gifted storytellers, right?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Later on, Swift will cement the local connection by playing, as a “secret” surprise acoustic song, “Sweet Nothing.” She doesn’t have to give the crowd any explanation for that: From the first notes, Irish Swifties will immediately recall that the lyrics reference to the coastal town of Wicklow. The real cherry on top of the show for locals at any international Eras Tour stop, though, comes with a customized moment each night during “We Are Never Getting Back Together” when the spotlight is put on backing dancer Kameron Saunders for a couple of seconds, as he blurts out something locally appropriate, and cheeky. One night in Dublin, it’s the Irish catchphrase “the neck of ye!”; on another, he yells out “pog mo thoin,” meaning “kiss my ass!”; the massive, knowing laugh that inside joke gets makes it clear this isn’t entirely an audience of American tourists after all.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">But the basic theatrics and emotional currents remain consistent from show to show. If Swift is surprisingly reticent to make her “Eras Tour” numbers public, that may be, in part, her desire to keep the focus primarily on a personal fan connection. Music industry veterans are taken aback by Swift’s ability to be giant and intimate onstage. “She’s a master marketer of herself — and she is not afraid to be vulnerable to her fans,” says Michele Bernstein, who runs a consultancy that works with stars like Drake. Bernstein could almost be quoting the lyrics of “Mastermind,” where Swift describes herself in almost comically omniscient terms, then dives into a bridge about how no one would play with her as a little girl.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">People like my guardian of the customs gate may complain about Swift’s songs centering on her romantic splits, but that subject matter magnifies her own insecurities and weaknesses, expressed in genuinely eccentric wordplay, in ways that keep the audience in thrall to someone they perceive as a humble underdog as well as a veritable cage fighter. She could do a $10 billion tour someday and still keep the crowd enraptured by how she measures up to, or rallies to exceed, the smallest man — or men, or Kardashians — who ever lived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/drums-GettyImages-2159729682-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This plays out in the “Eras” show in all sorts of symbolic ways, like the new segment in the “Tortured Poets” section where she seems to have fainted from the vapors of failed romance. Dancers in tuxedos try to revive her while a swing version of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” plays over the PA. A pair of women dressed as nurses fit her with what looks like a majorette’s uniform — or, with all its off-white stripes, is it really meant to resemble a straitjacket? The resemblance is probably not coincidental. Swift fans know there’s nothing like a mad woman.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The most exhilarating moment that has been added to the show this year has her gliding down the ramp on a platform, appearing to anyone at floor level like she is levitating like the witch she makes herself out to be in “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?” Taylor Swift: She was Agatha all along!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/little-old-GettyImages-2163970303-1-e1722435805451.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yes, there is much to unpack. But in Dublin and in every other city where “Eras” has alighted, there is also pure inspiration for those who maybe haven’t always felt like they’ve had a voice, whether it’s her LGBTQ+ fan base or, well, women. It’s a modern transmutation of Beatlemania in which Swift manages to be all four Fabs, and a mirror, as well as object, of that gaze. You don’t have to be a woman to experience the explosion of pure female joy that takes place on a mass scale at an “Eras” gig, but for men, it doesn’t hurt to have a healthy sense of where you might sit on the female spectrum.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Outside Aviva Stadium, two young Londoners have formed their own two-woman straight-gay alliance: One is wearing a shirt with the hand- drawn words “You’re obsessive and crazy,” and the other’s shirt has the phrase “You’re gay,” each with an arrow pointing to the other. This echoes the original lyrics to Swift’s 2006 oldie “Picture to Burn,” which was rerecorded after some were offended by “gay” as a possible teen epithet. “I am obsessive and crazy, and she is gay,” laughs Zoe Gibson, pointing to her friend, India Day. “We want to bring back the original lyrics. We never found them homophobic — we want to reclaim it.” Day adds, “We’ve listened to her since we were 4 years old, so obviously there’s the nostalgia factor. But for me, she speaks on quite a lot of issues like gay rights and feminism, and all of her songs perfectly sum up the experience of being a woman.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1109837.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Some of the shirts are apropos for Pride Month. Seeing a boy of no older than 15 or 16 wearing a homemade “But Daddy I Love Him” shirt (the title of a “Tortured Poets” fan favorite), it’s easy to imagine some courage was required to don that apparel. Along the same lines, I spot any number of women making their own statement in shirts with the modified exclamation “But Daddy I Love Her.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Gay or straight, 6 years old or 60-something, female or just female-allied, the crowd inside gets its sway on early in the show, with the arrival of the gentle, waltz-time “Lover.” It’s not one of the big set-pieces of this nonstop Broadway-style production — the spotlight is just on Swift and her acoustic guitar — but it might be the one where the entire audience feels like it’s at a four-minute campfire. No wicked witchiness here, just winsomeness.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Down on the floor, I’m seeing what amounts to a Taylor Swift mosh pit: gangs of two or three or five young women, ignoring the fact that Swift herself is just yards away from them on the ramp. They’re singing and acting out every last line to each other, as if the superstar isn’t even towering right over them. A waste of their euros? Hardly. Swift will capture their full attention again as the show proceeds, but in the moment, she isn’t just a superstar — she might be the world’s greatest community organizer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXOAjqasrKGTZLumw9Joq5qxnKS%2Fbr%2FWop2tZZWnrrR506isq2WZor2ir9NmaGtrZmWFeoGRbmY%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-impact-1236089525.html&title=A%20Worldwide%20Takeover%20and%20Its%20Cultural%20Impact" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-impact-1236089525.html&description=A%20Worldwide%20Takeover%20and%20Its%20Cultural%20Impact" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-impact-1236089525.html&title=A%20Worldwide%20Takeover%20and%20Its%20Cultural%20Impact" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-impact-1236089525.html&title=A%20Worldwide%20Takeover%20and%20Its%20Cultural%20Impact" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-impact-1236089525.html&text=A%20Worldwide%20Takeover%20and%20Its%20Cultural%20Impact" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-impact-1236089525.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Reinaldo Massengill</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-06-14</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./how-much-money-does-lyoto-machida-make-html.html><h3>&lt;&lt; How Much Money Does Lyoto Machida Make?
